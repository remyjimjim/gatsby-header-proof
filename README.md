#  Gatsby Header Proof

Proof of concept gatsby app.  

This app is the same as the gatsby-hello-world-starter template with the following mods:
- The header.js component has been modified to reflect the header markup in the _wwu-header.html file.
  There has also been a <Helmet> section added so that the js/wwu-header.js file is included in the <head> of the app.
  A button has been added above the header for testing custom jquery.
- The header.module.scss module has been modified to contain the sass code from _wwu-header.scss. 
- The header.module.css file is a verbatim copy of ashlar's build/components.css.
- The html.js file has been exposed so that the jquery CDN could be added to the <head>.

## Config:
- The gatsby docs process to add jquery to the app was followed.
- The gatsby helmet plugin was installed. 
- A top level dir named "ext" was created to house "extensions".  I've copied the current ashlar there for convenience. 
- The app runs on http://localhost:8000

## Current issues:
- The sass (header.module.scss) is almost working, but for some reason it can't see a variable ($medium) that should be available. For now it's using header.module.css.
- Having trouble getting "custom" javascript to execute when it's called from header.js component.  That's supposed to be what the Helmet plugin is for and the <script> tag is being added to the <head> but for some reason the javascript from the file js/wwu-header-test.js never fires. 
- Styling's off, probably needs to include some base styles.



## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
